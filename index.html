            <h2>What is a Trading Simulator?</h2>
            <p>A trading simulator is a tool that allows you to practice trading without risking real money. It simulates real market conditions, enabling you to trade with virtual funds. This is an excellent way to develop trading skills, test strategies, and gain experience without the risk of losing actual capital.</p>
            
            <h2>Benefits of Using a Trading Simulator</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Practice trading without financial risk.</li>
                <li>Learn how to trade and refine your strategies.</li>
                <li>Simulate real market conditions to evaluate your decisions.</li>
                <li>Build confidence in your trading abilities.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why Choose This Trading Simulator?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Completely free to use.</li>
                <li>No account required to get started.</li>
                <li>Simulate hundreds of trades in a single session using historical data.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
            <p>This simulator provides historical data for a random stock, allowing you to buy and sell shares at the current market price. Your profit or loss will be tracked in real-time. You can move forward in time by adding one day or more, and decide when to buy or sell based on the stock's performance. Note that currently, you can only buy or sell all shares in your portfolio at once. Individual share purchases or sales are not supported at this time.</p>

            <h2>Limitations & Future Plans</h2>
            <p>While the trading simulator is fully functional, there are features I'm planning to implement. For a running list of planned improvements, click <a href="roadmap.html">here</a>.</p>
